# skills.sh Registration

## Core Rule

Treat skills.sh listing as an automatic discovery and telemetry flow, not a manual submission form. A repository must be public and installable; `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` from a telemetry-enabled environment is the practical trigger for skills.sh to notice it.

## Use When

Use this when the user asks to register, publish, list, add, submit, or verify a skill repository on skills.sh, or when they ask how to make a GitHub skill repo appear on skills.sh.

Do not use this for ordinary skill authoring unless the goal includes skills.sh visibility.

## Quick Start

For `https://github.com/zouxingyuks/skills`:

```bash
npx skills add zouxingyuks/skills --list
npx skills add zouxingyuks/skills
```

Expected page and badge:

```md
https://skills.sh/zouxingyuks/skills
[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/zouxingyuks/skills)](https://skills.sh/zouxingyuks/skills)
```

## Workflow

1. Confirm the repository is public on GitHub and contains skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Check each `SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter with `name` and a trigger-rich `description` containing `Use when...`.
3. If the repo uses a root `skills.sh.json`, validate that it is display-only grouping metadata, not installation logic.
4. Keep `skills.sh.json` valid JSON with optional `$schema`, optional `notGrouped`, and `groupings` entries containing `title`, optional `description`, and `skills` slugs.
5. Push the repository to GitHub before trying to trigger listing.
6. Run `npx skills add <owner>/<repo> --list` to confirm the CLI can discover the repository's skills.
7. Run `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` from a normal environment where telemetry is not disabled.
8. Check `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>` and the badge URL after indexing/cache delay.

## skills.sh.json Pattern

Use skill slugs that match the skills.sh URL slug when possible. Matching is case-insensitive and treats spaces or underscores like hyphens; first group wins for duplicates. Skills that are not grouped appear under `Other skills`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://skills.sh/schemas/skills.sh.schema.json",
  "notGrouped": "bottom",
  "groupings": [
    {
      "title": "Skill Maintenance",
      "description": "Skills for reviewing, improving, and preserving agent skill guidance.",
      "skills": ["skill-retrospective", "skills-sh-registration"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the repo does not appear, confirm it is public and installable with `npx skills add <owner>/<repo> --list`.
- If telemetry is disabled, skills.sh may not see the install. Check `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, CI defaults, and shell environment.
- If `skills.sh.json` changes do not appear, validate JSON and wait for cache/indexing delay.
- Do not claim there is a manual submission button or a fixed install threshold unless current docs prove it.
- Do not treat `skills.sh.json` as required for listing; it customizes an existing repo page's grouping.

## Output Template

When reporting to the user, include:

- Repository: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`
- Discovery check: `npx skills add <owner>/<repo> --list`
- Listing trigger: `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>`
- Page: `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>`
- Badge markdown: `[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/<owner>/<repo>)](https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>)`
- Caveat: listing and grouping updates can lag because skills.sh aggregates telemetry and caches pages.
